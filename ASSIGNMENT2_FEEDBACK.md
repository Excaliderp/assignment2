Hi Timothy!

There's a few string methods - includes() and indexOf() - that we briefly covered in the slides in Week7 - Js 5 functions part 2 - that could have been very useful!

As you see below, you've ticked all the boxes, for your own knowledge maybe try to validate for letters only, and 'functionalise' some procedures but there's no need to resubmit.

Välgodkänt, very well done!
